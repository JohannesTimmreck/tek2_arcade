# tek2_arcade
This was a project during my 4th semester at Epitech. The goal of this project was to get more familiar with interfaces in object oriented programming and logic seperation. The project is split in 3 parts: the core, game logic and graphics logic.
We used SFML, ncurses and SDL2 libraries, so you will need at least one of them to run the project.
The 2 implemented games are nibbler and pacman.

Compile using tha Makefile

Usage: ./arcade path-to-graphics-module 

The path to the graphics lib describes the path to our module in the lib directory.

I worked on this project with Alexander Prosch and Jonas Conrad.
My part was mostly the design of the interfaces, the core and the Nibbler game.
